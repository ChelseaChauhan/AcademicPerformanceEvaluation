# ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION
With a great deal of advancement of social knowledge and the technology, every country needs  learning skills to help keep up with the development and uprising of science and technology. The development of technology has brought some benefits to the world. Not only is it more efficient, but the world has turned into a global village and access to information has become much easier. Community education systems, and thus education, cannot separate themselves from other social systems either national or international exchanges that are widely known in today’s global village.
The education sector is also not left behind in leveraging the deep resources of technology. Using information technology in today’s education is not merely an option, but a time saving and effective way to achieve the desired goals. For effective learning and effective management of both employees and the learners, educational institutes have found ways to integrate the use of information technology into their daily learning and management processes, giving them not only better results, but also saves a great amount of their precious time. One of the roles of the information system in training is to be able to provide the information it needs, when it is needed. We need to try to anticipate the information we need so that the information or data can be accessed when it is needed. The question arises is that how information technology has become an essential part of educational systems and their management.

## PROPOSED SYSTEM
Students' academic performance is evaluated based on their academic performance at institutes and universities. This system evaluates a student's academic performance. This method considers three parameters: attendance, internal grades, and external grades. These parameters are used to assess a student's final academic performance. Here, system is referred to an android application which will be used for the aforementioned evaluation. It consists of the following modules.

*Admin Module*
- Faculty register: Registration of faculty’s account.

*Student Module*
- Student Login : Login with valid username and password.
- View Academic performance : Student can view his/her academic performance based on attendance and marks.

*Faculty Module*
- Faculty Login: Login with valid username and password.
- Student register : Registration with basic details for student account.
- Fill Student Details : Insert proper details of attendance , marks of registered student.
- Evaluate Performance : Attendance and marks details of student gets applied and give the final academic performance result.

## CONCLUSION
Time is always important in today's always-on workforce. Access to real-time data on the student performance platform helps teachers and executives to respond quickly. A good evaluation using the right system helps in getting the most out of the frequent check-in and verification process as a whole. Students can use data-driven processes, bar graphs and line graphs to spotlight the performance areas they want to see the most. Instead of spending time tracking where they lacked, they can better address complex issues. 
The system enables the students to have a visual and easy to comprehend result in the form of charts. Proposed system provides easy to implement processes to both admin and the student along with the real-time data snapshots. Like everything else, a good performance evaluation process works only when it's actually used. It is not efficient for the admin to track key metrics in the old school manual process, like which student is getting better or worse.
It's important to understand the best way to approach an organization's performance evaluation system and record management. So never forget to let technology do the hard work. That way, you can focus on what's most important: the students.
